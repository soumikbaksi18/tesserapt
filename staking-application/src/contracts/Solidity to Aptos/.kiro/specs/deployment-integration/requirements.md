# Deployment and Frontend Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for creating comprehensive deployment documentation and frontend integration guides for the Bitmax Protocol Move contracts on Aptos. The documentation should enable developers of all skill levels to successfully deploy and integrate these smart contracts with frontend applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive Deployment Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want step-by-step deployment instructions so that I can successfully deploy the Bitmax Protocol contracts to Aptos networks without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer follows the deployment guide THEN they SHALL be able to deploy contracts to testnet successfully
2. WHEN a developer encounters issues THEN they SHALL find troubleshooting solutions in the documentation
3. WHEN a developer wants to deploy to mainnet THEN they SHALL have clear production deployment guidelines
4. IF a developer is new to Aptos THEN they SHALL find environment setup instructions
5. WHEN deployment is complete THEN the developer SHALL have contract addresses and verification steps

### Requirement 2: Frontend Integration Guide

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want detailed integration examples so that I can connect my application to the deployed smart contracts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a frontend developer wants to integrate THEN they SHALL find TypeScript/JavaScript examples
2. WHEN implementing wallet connection THEN they SHALL have wallet integration code samples
3. WHEN calling contract functions THEN they SHALL find function call examples with proper error handling
4. IF using React THEN they SHALL find React-specific integration patterns
5. WHEN handling transactions THEN they SHALL find transaction signing and submission examples

### Requirement 3: Development Environment Setup

**User Story:** As a new developer, I want complete environment setup instructions so that I can start development immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up development environment THEN the developer SHALL find OS-specific installation guides
2. WHEN installing dependencies THEN they SHALL have version-specific requirements
3. WHEN configuring tools THEN they SHALL find configuration file examples
4. IF encountering setup issues THEN they SHALL find common problem solutions
5. WHEN setup is complete THEN they SHALL be able to run tests successfully

### Requirement 4: API Reference Documentation

**User Story:** As an integrator, I want complete API documentation so that I can understand all available contract functions and their parameters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing contract functions THEN the developer SHALL find complete function signatures
2. WHEN understanding parameters THEN they SHALL find parameter types and descriptions
3. WHEN handling errors THEN they SHALL find error codes and meanings
4. IF looking for examples THEN they SHALL find usage examples for each function
5. WHEN planning integration THEN they SHALL find workflow diagrams and sequences

### Requirement 5: Testing and Validation Guides

**User Story:** As a developer, I want testing guidelines so that I can validate my deployment and integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing deployment THEN the developer SHALL find contract verification steps
2. WHEN testing integration THEN they SHALL find frontend testing examples
3. WHEN validating functionality THEN they SHALL find test scenarios and expected results
4. IF tests fail THEN they SHALL find debugging guides
5. WHEN ready for production THEN they SHALL find production readiness checklists

### Requirement 6: Security and Best Practices

**User Story:** As a developer, I want security guidelines so that I can deploy and integrate safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying contracts THEN the developer SHALL find security checklists
2. WHEN handling private keys THEN they SHALL find secure key management practices
3. WHEN implementing frontend THEN they SHALL find security best practices
4. IF handling user funds THEN they SHALL find additional security measures
5. WHEN going to production THEN they SHALL find production security requirements

### Requirement 7: Monitoring and Maintenance

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want monitoring guidelines so that I can maintain deployed contracts effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring contracts THEN the maintainer SHALL find monitoring setup guides
2. WHEN tracking usage THEN they SHALL find analytics integration examples
3. WHEN handling upgrades THEN they SHALL find upgrade procedures
4. IF issues occur THEN they SHALL find incident response procedures
5. WHEN scaling THEN they SHALL find performance optimization guides
